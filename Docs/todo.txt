List of things to work on code

get NonLinearCompton class working
get NonLinearBW class working

create abstract base class for particle pusher allowing different implimentations

Sort the setup of the laserfield. decide how foccusing is implimented
Make an imput script parser that outputs a struct to fill in all clases required

Proper test of ParticlePusher
proper test of LaserField

Method for finding chi is very bad leading to bad aliasing. needs improved

The method for energy split may be using wrong table

sort out how particle lists work and how particles are killed. Maybe add new particle for photons are positrons and electrons

Currently all events are generated at the star making it very memory intensive! change this by generating event within the event loop.

Add in check at end of inputs to make sure e.g. fields are set for processes

Change random number generator
